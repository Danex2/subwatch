## A discord bot that keeps track of youtube subscriber count

![image](https://i.imgur.com/gm87w1G.png)

## Commands
!set <channel_id> < name > | the name can be anything you want, better to be the same as the youtube channel to make it easier to remember  

!subs < name > | get the current subscriber count for the youtube channel  

!list | list the current channels being tracked  

!getid < name > | get the id of the channel by name (temporary fix for my problem)

## Notes & TODO
Currently you can only add channels that have an ID in the channel URL, eventually I'll make it to where you can use an ID or channel name
